Project Overview: Employee Payroll Management System
The Employee Payroll Management System is a database application designed to manage employee payroll information efficiently.
This system helps businesses keep track of employee details, pay periods, payroll records, and deductions.

Key Components:
Database: The project uses a database named EmployeePayrollDB to store all relevant data.

Tables:

Employeesdata: Stores information about employees, including their names, email addresses, job positions, salaries, hire dates, and employment status.
PayPeriods: Records the start and end dates for each pay period, allowing the business to manage payroll schedules.
Payroll: Contains payroll records for each employee linked to specific pay periods. It includes gross and net pay amounts.
Deductions: Tracks deductions (like health insurance or retirement contributions) for each employee, providing insight into total earnings.
Data Insertion: The system includes sample data for employees, pay periods, payroll records, and deductions to demonstrate its functionality.

Queries: The project allows for specific queries to retrieve payroll reports for certain pay periods and details of employee deductions.

Benefits:
Efficiency: Automates the payroll process, reducing manual calculations and errors.
Organization: Keeps all employee and payroll information structured and easily accessible.
Reporting: Enables businesses to generate reports on payroll and deductions, aiding in financial analysis and planning.
This system is a foundational tool that can be expanded with additional features such as employee attendance tracking, 
tax calculations, and performance management in the future.
